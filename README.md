Algorithms

This course is about the analysis and design of computer algorithms.

Various methods to analyze the correctness and asymptotic performance of algorithms, 
important algorithms (e.g., searching, sorting, path finding),
data structures (e.g., dynamic sets),
algorithmic design paradigms (e.g., randomized, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy),
hardness of problems (e.g., NP-completeness)
